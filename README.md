FlectoneTale is a lightweight Hytale server plugin designed to enhance player communication and server atmosphere. It introduces a simple chat system activated by a trigger character, alongside fully customizable welcome messages for new players.

- Use a designated trigger (default: !) to switch between a local chat (for nearby players) and a global chat (for the entire server). This helps keep discussions relevant and reduces spam in the main channel
- Greet every player with style and information. Create personalized welcome messages using placeholders and format them with color codes (&) for a unique first impression.
- Easily change the chat trigger, adjust chat radius, modify message formats, and translate all plugin text to match your server's language and theme
- The colors must be in hex format (#123456) and can be written into any part of the message insid

FlectoneTale uses a configuration with yaml files, which is very user-friendly (for new line in messages, use `\n`)
